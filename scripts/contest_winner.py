#    $ python3 path/to/contest_winner.py <term> [N]
#
#  this script will search the r/nearprog subreddit for a post with a title that
#  matches the search <term>, which is mandatory. Note that you can enter
#  multiple words as a search term by "surrounding them with quotes".
#
#  If only a single post is found which matches the search term, the script will
#  continue running by itself. If none are found, it will quit. If multiple
#  matching posts are found, the script will ask for user clarification.
#
#  The number of iterations N is optional and set to 5 by default, with an
#  enforced minimum of 2 iterations. 10-100 iterations are suggested.
